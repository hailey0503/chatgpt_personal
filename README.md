# Personalized ChatGPT using My Own Data with Python

**Description:**

This project demonstrates how to create a personalized version of ChatGPT using your own data and Python. By simply adding your dataset, you can achieve more tailored and specific responses in line with the interactions you desire.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python3
- OpenAI API key (Required for fine-tuning and interaction)

**Project Structure:**

- `data/`: Place your conversation dataset here.
- `fine_tune.py`: Python script for fine-tuning the model.
- `interact.py`: Python script for interacting with your personalized ChatGPT.
- `config.py`: Configuration file for API keys and other settings.

**Usage:**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gather your conversation dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
   - Ensure your dataset is cleaned and formatted properly.

2. **Fine-tuning:**
   - Open `fine_tune.py`.
   - Modify the hyperparameters and settings according to your dataset and requirements.
   - Run the script to fine-tune the language model using the OpenAI API.

3. **Setting Up API Calls:**
   - Rename `config_example.py` to `config.py`.
   - Add your OpenAI API key to the `config.py` file.

4. **Interaction:**
   - Open `interact.py`.
   - Customize the conversation flow and interaction logic as needed.
   - Run the script to interact with your personalized ChatGPT.

**Note:**

- Be mindful of ethical considerations when using AI models for personalized interactions.
- Ensure you handle user data and privacy in compliance with regulations.
